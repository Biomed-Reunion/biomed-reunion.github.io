## Basics

To view the effect of a change to the front end of the [website](https://biomed-reunion.github.io), go to the "Actions" tab in the web-based GitHub repository and make sure that the latest change (by validating the checksum) is successfully deployed to GitHub Pages. You may also need to clear any cache (or simply use the private/incognito mode on your favorite browser) to view the change. If no new workflow run is triggered after a modification to the repository is pushed, check [here](https://www.githubstatus.com/) to see if a certain functionality of GitHub is currently suffering from a technical outage.
